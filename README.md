# death-message-challenge
Minecraft Datapack (tested on 1.21.5-1.21.8, dunno how far you can downgrade) that makes players work together in a slew of different ways!

## Features:
Constantly moving worldborder <br>
Mod (FABRIC MOD, REQUIRES FABRIC API AND MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK) that detects specific ways a player has died<br>
/trigger reminder to see which deaths are still left<br>
description of death message available if players hover over it in chat<br>
Bossbar to show overall progress<br>
Players have a small score counter of the number of deaths they got for the team<br>
To make the game less biome dependent, another version is available under modified-biomes


## More technical stuff that is mostly for myself:
Players cannot set their spawnpoint
If a player joins midway through a match, their variables are set accordingly and they can join


## Todo list:
modified-biomes should have the biomes even more randomized + flower forest so bees are easier so its even better
